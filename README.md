- ðŸ‘‹ Hey there, I'm Afsar.
Lemme explain about me with some of my experiences.
First things first, I'm a fresher.
A Good Team Player: I came to know this while I was doing my academic project.
Never Give Up: I never give up on facing difficulty, I strongly believe in HardWork PaysOff.
Urge To Learn New Technologies: New techs attract me anytime, they cultivate an upstanding interest in me.
Passionate: I'm truly passionate about coding, I can say this by seeing some events in my life. The way I sticked with learning programming languages on my own even when understanding them annoyed me a lot, the way I try to create programs on my own. 
This passion of mine explains to me that I can work even in pressure conditions, can learn languages as per the requirement in time, and can work with my maximum throughput.
I'm a Fast learner.
A Good Motivator.
Can develop Leadership Skills with some experience.
Fitness Enthusiast.
Punctual.
